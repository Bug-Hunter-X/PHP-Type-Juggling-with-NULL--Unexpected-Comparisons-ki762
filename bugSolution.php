The solution is to use PHP's strict comparison operator (`===`) instead of the loose comparison operator (`==`). Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality, avoiding the type juggling that causes the unexpected behavior.

```php
<?php
$value = null;
if ($value === 0) {
    echo "Value is zero";
} else {
    echo "Value is not zero";
}

$value = null;
if ($value === "") {
  echo "Value is an empty string";
} else {
  echo "Value is not an empty string";
}
?>
```

Using strict comparison (`===`), the code now correctly identifies that `null` is neither equal to `0` nor to an empty string.  This ensures the intended logic is followed, preventing potential errors caused by type juggling.
