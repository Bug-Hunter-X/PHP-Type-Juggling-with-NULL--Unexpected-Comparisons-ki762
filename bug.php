In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with type juggling and comparisons involving `null`.  Consider this code snippet:

```php
$value = null;
if ($value == 0) {
    echo "Value is zero";
} else {
    echo "Value is not zero";
}
```

You might expect the output to be "Value is not zero" because `$value` is `null`. However, PHP's loose comparison (`==`) will trigger type juggling.  PHP converts `null` to an integer (0), resulting in the comparison `0 == 0`, which evaluates to `true`. The output becomes "Value is zero", which is unexpected.

Another instance is comparing `null` to an empty string:

```php
$value = null;
if ($value == "") {
  echo "Value is an empty string";
} else {
  echo "Value is not an empty string";
}
```

Similar to the previous case, PHP's loose comparison converts `null` to an empty string, making the comparison `"" == ""` which is true.  Thus, it prints "Value is an empty string", a behavior not immediately intuitive.
